// Let's say we have a robot and we want it to go and get some milk for us.
// So, instead of giving the robot commands each day, we can just simply create a function in which we can put in all the commands in order for our robot to get milk.
// So, instead of writing commands everyday, we can just call the function.

// Creating the function
function getMilk() {
  console.log("command-1");
  console.log("command-2");
  console.log("command-3");
  console.log("command-4");
  console.log("command-5");
  console.log("command-6");
  console.log("command-7");
  console.log("command-8");
  console.log("command-9");
  console.log("command-10");
  console.log("command-11");
  console.log("command-12");
}

// Calling the function
getMilk();
